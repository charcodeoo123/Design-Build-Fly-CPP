Summer leads 
Research project: advance our knowledge; write down ideas. Communicate with project manager
Read old design reports: what was good what was bad
Updated subteam descriptions and timeline
Compile new member training information and arrign other non-leads to organize and prepare presentations
Summer:
Check-in meetings: round table for research project updates
Prepare recruitment slides, form, information
Mid-august: begin thinking about kick off meeting time/location, subteam meeting preparations, google drive organization
September: plan meeting around 9/4 for beginning-of-year plan, preliminary design plan, and go over rules, lab manager inventory
Room reservation for subteam meetings
Begin FOM meetings weekly for preliminary design
Meeting 1: go over rules
Meeting 2: Scoring analysis
Meeting 3&4: Figure Of Merit
To beginning in early September
Kick off meeting; advertise well, show how to get to our room, prepare slides in advance
Information that needs to get to people
Meeting plans and schedule
Channel of communication links for people to join
Proposal writing: get outline

Early September 2022 Draft Rules released
Weekly design meetings and subteam meetings
Finish FOM, begin specific mission mechanism research development
Figure out way to get general members involved
Have a semi-complete general configuration done by week 3 for proposal purposes
Proposal Writing
Weekend after week 3: draft
Weekend after week 4: revise
Weekend after week 5: submit
Submission Late October, less than 2 months to research and write proposal

Week 6 to 10
Prototype 1 
CAD lead makes sure all parts are created in CAD, ready molds early
System/manufacture lead set up timeline and day-to-day planning of what needs to be done
Set up Saturday work days as well as increase work times during the week
Start manufacturing multiple times a week 

Prefer to have flight before winter break

Winter break 
Setting up the design report 
Follow prior comments, proposal comments, and scoring categories 
Start design report workdays on weekends 
Ask leads to fill in technical details
Preparing for winter 
Setup sub team meeting times and reserve meeting spaces 
Chief engineer to plan for overarching winter quarter week to week plan 

Week 1 to 4
fly days to gain mission score data 
Design Report
Weekly design report workdays (probably Sundays)
Prototype 
Continue manufacturing work days every saturday
Test mechanisms
Finish design of prototype 1
Competition planning
Figure out transportation and finalize AirBnB

Winter Week 5 to 7
Design Report
Continue pushing for progress
Final stretch, complete all sections with words at least one week before it’s due
Send to alumni for review Saturday before due
Intensive editing and revision process
Prototype: 
Finish manufacture of prototype 2
Competition planning
Start buying whatever we need for competition

Competition
Full itinerary: AirBnB ready, cars ready, drivers organized, (plan for some people who might want to fly out), figure out who’s going




Mission requirements:
Fly, got internal space, got good speed, have external systems with payload 
Ground mission: ground crew, loading unloading payload… tech inspection
2023 competition in Arizona, potential testing there.
Good DBF director communications
Final score is affected by the design report. 
Total mission score * Design report score

Competition Itinerary:
transportation/housing


Budget:
Ability to build prototypes lol
idk


Leads:
look for leads with good writing experience
Aerodynamics
CAD
Manufacturing
Structures numerical analytical analysis of aircraft components
Propulsion and electronics
Payload
System


RC airfields, if we already have one or sth idk, or talk with them in the summer 
Would like to start building in October
